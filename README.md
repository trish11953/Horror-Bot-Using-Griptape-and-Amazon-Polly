# Interactive Horror Story Bot

This interactive Python application utilizes the `griptape` library to create an Agent that operates under a specific set of rules to generate horror stories. The Agent, named "Horror Bot," is programmed to deliver a storytelling experience that adheres to the horror genre's characteristic sinister and creepy vibe. The story is interactive, with the user making choices that guide the direction of the narrative.
